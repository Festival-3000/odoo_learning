                The Invoice what is ordered rule is used as the default mode in Odoo Sales, which means customers are invoiced once the sales order is confirmed.

                The Invoice what is delivered rule invoices customers once the delivery is done. This rule is often used for businesses that sell materials, liquids, or food in large quantities. In these cases, the ordered quantity may differ slightly from the delivered quantity, making it preferable to invoice the quantity actually delivered.

In turn, the seller provides goods or services to the buyer after accepting the down payment, trusting that the remaining amount will be paid later on.
